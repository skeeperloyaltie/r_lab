### Steps you need to implement in R (Show the code and the results/outputs for each section):
  - 1- Upload data to R and view the structure of data, dimensionality, and attribute names
  - 2- Explain what attributes you are using for clustering and why?
  - 3- Apply clustering on the dataset for several K values, e.g., 3, 4 and 5
  - 4- Plot the model and show the centroids for each K selected in the previous question
  - 5- Select different attributes and show which ones show good clusters
  - 6- Find the most important attributes using information gain of gain ration   
  - 7- Apply classification using decision tree on the most 4 important attributes
  - 8- Plot the model of classification
